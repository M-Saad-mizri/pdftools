   - **No File Limits**: No "Daily Limit" or "File Size Limit" — it uses your own computer's power.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

Your data **never leaves your computer**.  
Most online PDF tools upload your files to their servers, posing a security risk. PDFCraft Pro uses:

- **PDF-Lib** & **PDF.js**: To process document logic inside the browser tab.
- **WebAssembly/JavaScript**: To handle heavy lifting without a backend.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project utilizes the latest web technologies to provide a "Software as a Service" (SaaS) experience in a single file:

- **Tailwind CSS** – Sleek, responsive, and modern UI
- **PDF-Lib** – Core engine for creating, merging, and modifying PDF documents
- **PDF.js** – Mozilla's powerful library for rendering and reading PDFs
- **SortableJS** – Intuitive drag-and-drop file reordering
- **Lucide Icons** – Beautiful, consistent iconography

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone/Download**: Download the `index.html` file (or clone the repository).
2. **Open**: Double-click the file to open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. **Process**: Select your tool, upload your files, and click **Process & Download**.
